Banjara Seva Samithi (BSS) is a dynamic, community-driven organization dedicated to empowering the tribal communities of Telangana, with a special focus on the Banjara (Lambada) population. Founded with the vision of nurturing future leaders from marginalized tribal backgrounds, BSS stands as a beacon of inclusive education, social reform, and self-reliance.

Our flagship initiative, the BSS High-Standard English Medium School, located in the tribal agency area of Mahabubabad district, offers holistic, digitalized education to underprivileged tribal children from kindergarten through Class 10. The school bridges the vast cultural and linguistic divide between tribal hamlets and mainstream academic systems by offering high-quality education in English while honoring the children’s tribal roots and cultural identity.

With over 99% pass percentage in SSC exams, BSS has consistently delivered academic excellence, while also fostering values of dignity, leadership, and social justice. Our motto – “Future Leaders of Nation – From Tribals to Global Citizens” – reflects our deep commitment to nurturing children who can compete globally while staying rooted in their traditions.

BSS also actively collaborates with government and private partners through CSR projects, donor support, and educational outreach to provide residential facilities, nutritious food, clothing, medical care, and emotional support to its students – many of whom are first-generation learners.

We are proud torchbearers of the Aadi Karmayogi movement, with official recognition and registration under various tribal welfare schemes. Through grassroots initiatives and youth leadership, BSS strives to transform not just individual lives, but entire communities.

Join us in this journey of empowerment, inclusion, and nation-building.
